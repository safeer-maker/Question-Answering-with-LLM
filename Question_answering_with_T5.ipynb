In fact, often times the path you take to get to one place will be different from the path the traffic takes to get back to you!

       "   \"I think that the closest you are going to find to the Nexus Hub from the movie is an [Internet Exchange](_URL_5_). These are basically just locations where networks meet. The first major Exchange was [MAE East](_URL_6_), which actually was basically a single centralized point that most internet traffic routed to. \\n\\nAt one point it was the main way for traffic to be exchanged between ISPs. For example, before DE-CIX went in in Germany, the three telecoms there all routed their traffic across the ocean to MAE East, even if it was just going to connect to one of the other German ISPs. Eventually they realized this was really really really slow, so they started an exchange in Frankfurt, Germany (DE-CIX).\\n\\nIf you are really interested in this, I would highly recommend reading [Tubes: A Journey to the Center of the Internet](_URL_6_). It is very well written, and although I was already familiar with most of the internals of how things worked, it definitely isn't required to already understand the process. \\n\\nEdit: I also found [this list of internet exchanges by size](_URL_4_)\",\n",
       "   'Part of the beauty of the internet is that there doesn\\'t really need to be a \"core\" in the common sense. There does have to be a centralized domain name management system, but the internet itself could function without that - you\\'d just have to memorize a lot of IP addresses because there would be no guarantee that only one person has a domain name (in theory DNS could still work, but there would be no guarantees of your destination).\\n\\nIn terms of critical infrastructure and protocols, I think the Border Gateway Protocol, and its associated routers, would be the closest you can get. According to one of my old textbooks, which I sadly no longer have, disabling BGP routers (or even configuring them incorrectly) can cause large swaths of geographic territory to disappear from the internet.\\n\\nWhile it\\'s not peer-reviewed or a textbook, [this site](_URL_7_) explains the importance of the protocol itself and of configuring the routers securely and correctly.\\n\\nI\\'ve been out of the field for a while now, so if anyone else has additional information on this, I\\'d love to hear another opinion.',\n",
       "   \"DNS root servers. There's 13 of them, in the world. I believe that at one point, the military owner the majority of them and decided to make them more public, and turned over control to schools and authoritative bodies. \\n\\nDNS changes a name or word into a number, and a number to a name. When you go to _URL_8_, your computer requests the IP for that site. Your local DNS server will more than likely have this IP and give it to you. Then, your computer reaches out to that IP, and the next thing you know, you're looking up funny cat videos. \\n\\nBut, what happens if your local DNS server doesn't know about the website you request? It has a kind of parent DNS server, and it will make the same request to its parent. As you go up the chain, you start getting less and less servers, until you're left with the 13 root servers. Not a single Nexus, but definitely the closest thing we have to it. \\n\\nYou can also go from IP to name. Nslookup 8.8.8.8 will resolve to a Google server. In this case, it's google's public DNS, free to use by anyone. \\n\\nAlong the same lines, the dark net is only dark because it's not registered in DNS.

       "   \"There isn't a single hub, but what you are looking for are called the DNS root name servers. These 13 server farms, located around the world, hold the ultimate key that decides where each packet travels on the internet (for all intents and purposes. There are some exceptions, but I won't go into them here). DNS, or domain name service, is what translates *_URL_10_ to *204.85.30.102*. It takes the URL you put in the address bar and converts it to the IP address registered to that URL. This is important because computers don't inherently know which computer is at which URL. They have to look up the IP address first, and then they can use that tot communicate. \\n\\nDNS does the job of translating URLs to IP addresses for your computer. Without this service, you can't access the internet unless you know which IP address you are trying to get to. There are multiple levels of DNS, from the local cache that is stored on some computers, to the caches stored by Tier 1 and 2 ISPs (internet service providers), all the way up to the DNS root name servers. These root name servers are the end all be all for routing IP packets. If they were updated to say that *_URL_11_* was registered to the IP address *31.192.117.132* then you would be automatically redirected to _URL_12_ everytime you typed _URL_13_ into the URL address bar at the top of your browser.\",\n",

That said, Internet Protocols do not rely on such central services, so if they went away, the net could route around them.\",\n",
       "   'To add to what others are saying.

As others have answered, there are multiple circuits and multiple routers between the various endpoints on the Internet, so there is really no such thing as a single 'hub'. Probably the best way to bring down the modern Internet would be to poison several root DNS servers, which would interfere with network hosts and smaller DNS servers from successfully looking up IP addresses for hostnames.\",\n",

And if the input number is somewhere between 0.01 and 0.02, it takes the input number and the 2 nearest answers it has, and it runs a fairly simple interpolation equation which consists of adding and subtracting and multiplying and dividing with those 3 numbers and some constants like 1 and -3 and 5.

I\\'m belaboring a simple point, but the ratio is going to be divided by the length of the line.  \\n\\nSo sin is the value of the distance to the horizon, proportional to the distance from the origin.  \\n\\nIf you were to draw the shortest line possible to the horizon from the end of your line, you would have a right-angle triangle. This is where the right angle triangles come from.  The reason sine is opposite over hypotenuse is because the \"opposite\" length is the distance to the horizon.  The \"hypotenuse\" length is the length of the ruler.  \\n\\nWhat you are really measuring is for a line at an angle of x, how far does it diverge from the horizon for every unit it goes away from the origin.\\n\\nFor cosine it\\'s a question of how far does it diverge from a line perpendicular to the horizon for every unit it moves from the origin. \\n\\nThe rest are all kind of secondary and have more to do with circles.\\n\\nTangent is a bit different.  It\\'s used less, and is often really just a composite of sine and cosine.  \\n\\nI\\'ll start with why it\\'s called a tangent.  If you have a circle, at any point along the circle you can draw a line to the center of the circle.  The line that is at a right angle to the line you drew is a tangent. \\n\\nSo if you take the line you drew, and use a compass to make a circle whose center is in the origin, and which touches the end of the line, we can use that to talk about the others.\\n\\nIf you draw a straight line that is tangential to your circle, touching it on the horizon, it will be perpendicular to the horizon.  If you extend the line that you drew until it meets that point on the tangent line, the distance to the horizon from where your angle meets that tangent line is the tangent.\\n\\nIf you think about what\\'s happening there, it\\'s very similar to the sine.  You\\'re getting the distance that it has diverged from the horizon, but instead of being relative to the length of the whole line that you extended to the tangent line, it is relative to the distance you first drew.  This is the same as the radius of the circle.\\n\\nSince these are all just ratios, as long as you scale them uniformly, they will stay the same.  So instead draw the same angle at one ruler length, and connect it to the horizon as a right angled triangle.  Then instead of drawing a circle that touches the end of your angle, draw it so that it touches the right angle formed.  That line you extended down is the tangent line we drew in the first example.  Like the first example it is relative to the distance from the origin to where the angle touches the circle.  Since that\\'s the same anywhere, because it\\'s a circle, the distance along the horizon works as well.\\n\\nSo on that triangle, we have the distance from the angle to the horizon, and then we have the distance along the horizon to where it intersects with the line we draw from the end of the angle.  The distance to the horizon in that case is the \"opposite\" length, and the radius of the circle that would be drawn will be the same as the \"adjacent\" length.  \\n\\nThis is why tangent is called tangent, and why it\\'s calculated as opposite over adjacent. \\n\\nSo then you have cotangent, which is essentially the same thing as tangent, but measures the length of a tangent line perpendicular to tangent.  For all the same reasons it\\'s going to be adjacent over opposite.   Just like sine and cosine it\\'s the same function, just compared to a different plane.\\n\\nSo then what is secant and cosecant? \\n\\nWell, when we first did our tangent example, we extended the line we drew for the angle up to the tangent line.  The secant is the length of the whole line if you were to attach it to the tangent.  \\n\\nSo how do we come up with that?  Well consider how we got the tangent.  Instead of using the hypotenuse for scaling like we did for sin and cos, we used the adjacent length to scale.\\n\\nFor secant we are doing the same thing.  We want to find the length of the line drawn to the tangent relative to one unit of measurement.   So we draw an angle that is one unit long, and turn it into a right triangle.  We draw a circle with the center on the origin and the edge of the circle on the point where the horizon touches the right angle.  Now secant is asking the question \"how many times longer than the radius of this circle is the distance to that tangent line?\"  But like tangent, since the radius of the circle is the same anywhere, if we know the adjacent distance it is the same.  The length of the whole line is the hypotenuse.  So we find the secant by dividing the hypotenuse length by the adjacent length.\\n\\nSecant happens to be the reciprocal of the cosine function, but the questions that secant asks have to do with distances to the x-axis.\\n\\nCosecant asks the same questions, but like all of its friends is doing so relative to the y-axis.  Again, it happens to be the reciprocal of the sin function, but that can be confusing.\\n\\n\\nIn short, \\n\\n* sin is the distance of an angle to the horizon\\n* tan is the length of a line segment tangential to a circle touching the horizon and a beam cast by the angle.\\n* secant is the length of the line segment required to intersect with that tangent line relative to the radius of the circle that line is tangential to. \\n* cos, cot, csc are all the same functions, but they are relative to the y-axis rather than the x-axis. \\n* Also, SOHCAHTOA.  That will help you remember how, but not why.',\n",
       "    \"I think an intuitive way is to imagine a simple 2d game (by the way the same is also completely true of 3d but it needlessly complicates it for this example). Imagine you have a ship at the center of a map. We'll consider this point to be 0,0. The ship can rotate and change its heading which we'll consider as being in degrees, and it can forward/backwards along its current heading. So the question is when the ship decides to go forward 1 unit, how do we know how much its x and y coordinates have changed? I mean if its facing due east then we know its x changes +1 and the y changes 0. Similarly if its facing due north then its y changes 1 and its x changes 0. What if its facing at a 35 degree angle?\\n\\nLike others have said this is where we can understand and actually use sin/cos. It's oddly enough incredibly simple. x = cosine. y = sine. If your ship is facing at a 35 degree angle then the factor of the change in x is cos(35) and similarly the factor of the change in y is sin(35). \\n\\nxFactor = cos(35) = 0.81915204428\\nyFactor = sin(35) = 0.57357643635\\n\\nNow let's say our ship has a velocity of 2. We now have enough to calculate its new position!\\n\\nxChange = xFactor * velocity = 0.81915204428 * 2 = 1.63830408856\\nyChange = yFactor * velocity = 0.57357643635 * 2 = 1.1471528727\\n\\nSo if our ship started at 0,0 with a velocity of 2 on a heading of 35 degrees, it's new position would simply be: 1.64, 1.15. Okay, perhaps you're thinking that's a lot of movement when it was only supposed to go 2 units. Well we can prove this is correct using the pythagorean theorem as well! Draw a right triangle with a base of 1.64, a height of 1.15 and let's get the distance it traveled on the top - the hypotenuse.\\n\\na^2 + b^2 = c^2. \\n1.64^2 + 1.15^2 = c^2\\n4 = c^2\\nc = 2\\n\\nWe traveled exactly 2 units.\\n\\nTangent is just a shortcut that is useful for a lot of neat things. Take your yFactor up above and divide it by your xFactor. That's tangent. In this case that'd be 0.57357643635/0.81915204428 = 0.70020753821 which is indeed the tangent of 35 degrees!\\n\\nGoing back the initial topic. If we're going due east then we know our ship is only going to move along the east. So xFactor = 1, yFactor = 0. As you can verify cos(0) = 1, sin(0) = 0.\\n\\nHopefully if you think about this then you could instantly and intuitively determine the sin/cos of 0,90,180 and 270 degrees. And from there you could also even get the tangent! With a little bit of thinking you should even be able to ballpark any sin/cos/tan, something the vast majority of people ~~cannot~~ *do not know how to* do!\",\n",
